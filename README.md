# Jodspace

Jodspace is a small collaborative editor built as a demonstration project. This demo primarily focuses on:

- Real-time collaboration logic using yjs
- CI using GitHub Actions and a Docker Registry
- CD using a local K3s cluster with Argo CD

The UI (HTML + CSS) is intentionally minimal and were vibe-coded.
